If the anchor date is itself an adjustable date then the offset is assumed to be calculated from the adjusted anchor date. A number of different scenarios can be supported, namely; 1) the derived date may simply be a number of calendar periods (days, weeks, months or years) preceding or following the anchor date; 2) the unadjusted derived date may be a number of calendar periods (days, weeks, months or years) preceding or following the anchor date with the resulting unadjusted derived date subject to adjustment in accordance with a specified business day convention, i.e. the derived date must fall on a good business day; 3) the derived date may be a number of business days preceding or following the anchor date. Note that the businessDayConvention specifies any required adjustment to the unadjusted derived date. A negative or positive value in the periodMultiplier indicates whether the unadjusted derived precedes or follows the anchor date. The businessDayConvention should contain a value NONE if the day type element contains a value of Business (since specifying a negative or positive business days offset would already guarantee that the derived date would fall on a good business day in the specified business centers).",
