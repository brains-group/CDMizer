This is because the contract is an interest rate swap contract with a European exercise style, which means that the exercise can only occur at the end of the term.\n\n**Additional Data:**\n\nSince the prior context (path) is `trade.tradableProduct.product.contractualProduct.economicTerms.terminationProvision.cancelableProvision.exerciseTerms`, I will also populate the `exerciseTerms` object with the relevant data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"exerciseTerms\": {\n    \"style\": \"European\",\n    \"followUpConfirmation\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `exerciseTerms` object is populated with the relevant data from the contract description.
