However, we can infer that the settlement type is likely to be \"Fixed\" based on the following information:\n\n* The contract is an Interest Rate Swap Contract, which typically involves a fixed rate payment.\n* The Economic Terms section mentions a \"Fixed Rate\" specification.\n* The Payout section mentions a \"Price Quantity\" of EUR 20,000,000, which is a fixed amount.\n\n**Populated Placeholder:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I will populate the placeholder with the best-suited information:\n\n`{{ settlementType }} = Fixed`\n\n**Updated Prior Context:**\n\nThe updated prior context will be:\n\ntrade.tradableProduct.tradeLot[0].priceQuantity[0].settlementTerms.settlementType = \"Fixed\"\n\nThe populated placeholder and updated prior context reflect the best-suited information from the contract description and prior context."
