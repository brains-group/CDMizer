The `fixedRate` and `floatingRate` properties are strings, while the `calculationPeriod` and `paymentDates` properties are strings with additional information.\n\nThe populated placeholder is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"fixedRate\": 4.427,\n  \"floatingRate\": \"Mexican TIIE (Tipo de Inter\u00e9s Interbancario)\",\n  \"calculationPeriod\": \"Annually, from October 5 to October 5 of the consecutive year\",\n  \"paymentDates\": \"Annually, 2 business days after October 5, commencing on October 7, 2011, and ending on October 7, 2015\"\n}\n```",
