The fallback rate has a spread adjustment.\n\nThe spread adjustment is not explicitly mentioned in the contract description, but based on the context, I can infer that it is related to the floating rate. In interest rate swaps, the spread adjustment is typically used to adjust the floating rate to account for any differences between the actual and expected interest rates.\n\nBased on the examples provided, I will populate the placeholder with a JSON object that includes the spread adjustment. Since the spread adjustment is not explicitly mentioned in the contract description, I will leave it as an empty string.\n\nHere is the populated placeholder:\n\n```json\n\"spreadAdjustment\": {\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"globalKey\": \"spreadAdjustment\"\n  },\n  \"value\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since the spread adjustment is not explicitly mentioned in the contract description, I will leave it as an empty string. If the spread adjustment is not applicable, it is better to leave it as an empty string rather than providing incorrect information.\n\nIf the spread adjustment is applicable, I would need more information to populate the placeholder correctly."

The compounding method is specified as \"Floating Rate\" with a rate option of \"EUR-LIBOR-BBA\".\n\nHowever, the compounding method is not explicitly mentioned as \"Floating Rate\" in the provided examples. Instead, it is mentioned as \"Flat\" in the examples. Since the examples illustrate the type of information contained in similar keys, I will follow the examples and populate the placeholder with the value \"Flat\".\n\nHere is the populated placeholder:\n\n```\n\"compoundingMethod\" : \"Flat\"\n```\n\nNote that I have maintained the same datatype as the placeholder, which is a string.",

The interest rate payout has a payer receiver, price quantity, and other details.\n\nSince the placeholder is not provided, I will assume it is an empty string (\"\") and replace it with a string derived from the contract information.\n\nThe key \"cashflowsMatchParameters\" is related to the cash flow representation of the interest rate payout. Based on the provided examples, I will populate the placeholder with a boolean value indicating whether the cash flows match the parameters.\n\nHere is the populated placeholder:\n\n```json\n\"cashflowsMatchParameters\" : true\n```\n\nHowever, since the provided examples show that the \"cashflowsMatchParameters\" key can have different values (true or false), I will provide both options:\n\n```json\n\"cashflowsMatchParameters\" : true\n\"cashflowsMatchParameters\" : false\n```\n\nBased on the context, it seems that the interest rate swap contract has a fixed rate and a floating rate, which may affect the cash flows. Therefore, I will provide both options to reflect the different scenarios.\n\nIf the placeholder is a list containing a single object (e.g., `[{...}]`), I will populate it with a list of objects following the exact same structure. However, in this case, the placeholder is not a list, so I will not create a list of objects.\n\nIf the placeholder is an empty list (\"[]\"), I will populate it with a list of items derived from the contract information. However, in this case, the placeholder is not an empty list, so I will not create a list of items.\n\nIf no highly relevant data exists for the given key, I will leave its placeholder as-is. In this case, I have found relevant data for the key \"cashflowsMatchParameters\", so I will populate the placeholder accordingly.",

Specifically, it is mentioned that the \"Payment Frequency\" is 6 months, and the \"PayRelativeTo\" is the \"Calculation Period End Date\".\n\nBased on this information, I will populate the placeholder as follows:\n\n```json\n\"adjustedPaymentDate\": \"1995-06-14\"\n```\n\nThis is because the first payment date is 6 months after the effective date of December 14, 1994, which is June 14, 1995.\n\nNote that I have maintained the same datatype as the placeholder, which is a string representing a date.",

The payer receiver structure indicates that Party A (549300VBWWV6BYQOWM67) pays to Party B (529900DTJ5A7S5UCBB52).\n\nBased on this information, I will populate the placeholder for the key \"initialPayment\" as follows:\n\n```json\n\"initialPayment\": true\n```\n\nThis is because the interest rate swap contract has an initial payment structure where Party A pays to Party B.\n\nNote that the placeholder is a boolean value indicating whether the initial payment is made or not. In this case, the initial payment is made, so the value is set to true.",

The interest rate payout details are as follows:\n\n* Payer Receiver: Party A (549300VBWWV6BYQOWM67) pays to Party B (529900DTJ5A7S5UCBB52)\n* Price Quantity: 50000000.00 EUR\n* Rate Specification: Floating Rate\n* Floating Rate:\n\t+ Rate Option: EUR-LIBOR-BBA\n\t+ Index Tenor: 6 months\n* Day Count Fraction: ACT/360\n* Calculation Period Dates:\n\t+ Effective Date: December 14, 1994\n\t+ Termination Date: December 14, 1999\n\t+ Calculation Period Frequency: 6 months\n\t+ Roll Convention: 14\n* Payment Dates:\n\t+ Payment Frequency: 6 months\n\t+ PayRelativeTo: Calculation Period End Date\n\t+ Payment Dates Adjustments: Business Day Convention: MODFOLLOWING\n* Reset Dates:\n\t+ ResetRelativeTo: Calculation Period Start Date\n\t+ Fixing Dates: -2 days\n\t+ Reset Frequency: 6 months\n\t+ Reset Dates Adjustments: Business Day Convention: MODFOLLOWING\n\nBased on the above information, I can see that the final payment is related to the interest rate payout. Since the interest rate payout is a floating rate, the final payment will be determined based on the floating rate at the time of payment.\n\nTo populate the placeholder, I will create a JSON object that represents the final payment details. Since the prior context is a list of interest rate payout objects, I will create a list of final payment objects.\n\nHere is the populated placeholder:\n\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"finalPaymentSchedule\": {\n      \"finalPaymentDate\": {\n        \"unadjustedDate\": \"1999-12-14\"\n      },\n      \"finalPaymentAmount\": {\n        \"value\": 50000000.00\n      }\n    },\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"globalKey\": \"finalPayment-1\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"finalPaymentSchedule\": {\n      \"finalPaymentDate\": {\n        \"unadjustedDate\": \"1999-12-14\"\n      },\n      \"finalPaymentAmount\": {\n        \"value\": 50000000.00\n      }\n    },\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"globalKey\": \"finalPayment-2\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nNote that I have created two final payment objects, one for each party (Party A and Party B). The final payment date and amount are the same for both parties, as the interest rate payout is a floating rate and the final payment will be determined based on the floating rate at the time of payment.",

The interest rate payout has a payer receiver structure where Party A pays to Party B.\n\nThe relevant information for the key \"intermediatePayment\" can be found in the \"Product Details\" section under \"Economic Terms\" where it is mentioned that the interest rate payout has a payer receiver structure where Party A pays to Party B.\n\nSince the placeholder for \"intermediatePayment\" is not provided, I will assume it is an empty string (\"\") and replace it with a STRING derived from the contract information.\n\nThe best-suited information for the key \"intermediatePayment\" is the fact that Party A pays to Party B. Therefore, I will populate the placeholder with the string \"Party A pays to Party B\".\n\nHere is the populated JSON key:\n\n```json\n\"intermediatePayment\": \"Party A pays to Party B\"\n```\n\nHowever, based on the examples provided, it seems that the key \"intermediatePayment\" should be a boolean value indicating whether an intermediate payment is made. In this case, the interest rate swap contract has a payout structure with an interest rate payout, which implies that intermediate payments are made.\n\nTherefore, I will populate the placeholder with the boolean value `true`.\n\nHere is the populated JSON key:\n\n```json\n\"intermediatePayment\": true\n```",

The relevant section is:\n\n**Cash Settlement Amount**\n\nIn the event of early termination, the party that is out-of-the-money shall pay to the party that is in-the-money the cash settlement amount, which shall be an amount in EUR equal to the absolute value of the market value of the contract, as determined on the Mandatory Early Termination Date.\n\nBased on this information, I will populate the placeholder as follows:\n\n```json\n\"settlementType\": \"Cash\"\n```\n\nThe reason for this is that the contract specifies a cash settlement amount in case of early termination, which implies that the settlement type is indeed \"Cash\".",

The relevant information is:\n\n* \"Payout: Interest Rate Payout\"\n* \"Interest Rate Payout: Party A (549300VBWWV6BYQOWM67) pays to Party B (529900DTJ5A7S5UCBB52)\"\n\nSince the prior context is related to the settlement terms, I will focus on the settlement type. The settlement type is not explicitly mentioned in the contract description, but based on the context, I can infer that the settlement type is likely \"Physical\" or \"Cash\", as it is a common practice in interest rate swaps.\n\nHowever, the contract description mentions \"Cash Settlement Amount\" and \"Cash Settlement Terms\", which suggests that the settlement type is indeed \"Cash\".\n\nTherefore, I will populate the placeholder with the value \"Cash\".\n\nHere is the populated placeholder:\n\n`\"settlementType\": \"Cash\"`"
