The parties represent that they have made their own independent decisions to enter into this contract and have sufficient financial resources to bear the risks associated with it.\n\n**Representations**\n\nEach party represents to the other party that they have the power to enter into this contract and have taken all necessary action to authorize its execution and performance.\n\n**Governing Law**\n\nThis contract is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein.\n\n**Calculation Agent**\n\nThe calculation agent for this contract is Party1 (HSBCGB01).\n\n**Valuation Statements**\n\nValuation statements will be made available to Party2 on the Optimize platform.\n\n- Prior Context (Path):\ntrade.tradableProduct.product.contractualProduct.economicTerms.payout.optionPayout[0].exerciseTerms.style\n\n### Task:\n\nFind a value that is best suited for the provided key from the provided derivatives contract. Use the key and prior context to accurately find the value.\n\n### Solution:\n\nBased on the prior context `trade.tradableProduct.product.contractualProduct.economicTerms.payout.optionPayout[0].exerciseTerms.style`, we are looking for the style of the exercise terms of the payout option.\n\nFrom the contract description, we can see that the payout option is related to the cash settlement in USD. Therefore, we can infer that the style of the exercise terms is likely to be related to the valuation method used for the cash settlement.\n\nBased on this information, we can populate the placeholder with the following value:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"style\": \"valuation method based on BRL.PTAX/BRL09 settlement rate option\"\n}\n```\n\nThis value is a string, which matches the expected datatype of the placeholder.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\nstyle\n{\n  \"style\": \"valuation method based on BRL.PTAX/BRL09 settlement rate option\"\n}\n```",

The best-suited information for the `settlementType` key is the \"Cash\" settlement type.\n\n### Maintaining the Same Datatype\n\nSince the placeholder is an empty string (`\"\"`), we will replace it with a STRING.

This implies that there will be multiple observation dates during this period.\n\nThe prior context `trade.tradableProduct.product.contractualProduct.economicTerms.payout.performancePayout[0].observationTerms.numberOfObservationDates` suggests that we are looking for the number of observation dates for the performance payout.\n\n### Populating the Placeholder with Relevant Data\n\nBased on the contract description, we can infer that there will be 2 observation dates for the performance payout, one at the beginning of the tenor period and another at the end of the tenor period.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"observationDate\": \"April 1, 2013\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"observationDate\": \"October 1, 2013\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Maintaining the Same Datatype\n\nThe placeholder is an empty list (\"[]\"), so we populate it with a LIST of items derived from the contract information.
