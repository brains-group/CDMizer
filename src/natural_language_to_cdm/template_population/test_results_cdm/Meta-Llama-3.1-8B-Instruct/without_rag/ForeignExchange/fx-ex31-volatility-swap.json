This is because the contract is an FX Volatility Swap, which is typically priced using the Black-Scholes model. The option payout is also described as being based on the USD Notional Amount, which is consistent with the Black-Scholes model.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model is a widely used option pricing model that takes into account factors such as volatility, time to expiration, and interest rates. It is commonly used for pricing European-style options, which is consistent with the option payout described in the contract.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the style of the option payout is a Black-Scholes model, and we can populate the placeholder with this value.",

This indicates that we are looking for the settlement type within the `settlementTerms` section of the `optionPayout` object.\n\nFrom the contract description, we can see that the `Payout` section mentions that \"Party A pays (in USD) 4.427% p.a. on the USD Notional Amount, while Party B pays USD SOFR-COMPOUND p.a. on USD Notional Amount.\" This implies that the settlement type is related to the payment terms of the contract.\n\nHowever, the exact settlement type is not explicitly mentioned in the contract description. But, based on the context, we can infer that the settlement type is likely to be \"Physical\" or \"Cash\", as these are common settlement types for derivatives contracts.\n\nGiven the context and the information available, we can populate the placeholder with the value \"Physical\" or \"Cash\".

This suggests that we need to find the number of observation dates related to the performance payout.\n\nFrom the contract description, we can see that the `performancePayout` section has a single item, which is an object with an `observationTerms` property. The `observationTerms` property has a `numberOfObservationDates` property, which is the key we are interested in.\n\nHowever, the contract description does not provide a direct value for `numberOfObservationDates`. Instead, it provides a description of the observation terms, which includes the pricing time, business center, information source, observable, and quote basis.\n\nTo populate the placeholder, we can infer that the number of observation dates is likely related to the frequency of the performance payout. Based on the contract description, the performance payout is paid annually, and the observation terms are related to the pricing of the currency pair EUR/USD.\n\nTherefore, we can assume that the number of observation dates is equal to the number of years over which the performance payout is paid. In this case, the performance payout is paid from 2014 to 2033, which is a total of 20 years.\n\n### Populating the Placeholder with the Correct Datatype\n\nThe placeholder is an empty string, so we need to replace it with a string that represents the number of observation dates. We can use the inferred value of 20 years to populate the placeholder.\n\n```json\n\"numberOfObservationDates\": \"20\"\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n\"numberOfObservationDates\": \"20\"\n```"
