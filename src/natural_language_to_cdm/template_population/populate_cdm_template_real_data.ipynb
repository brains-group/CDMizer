    "        - DO NOT change types. If the given object is a LIST, the returned object also MUST be a LIST, and so on.\n",

    "\n",
    "        1. **Preserve the structure of the JSON object**:\n",
    "        -  DO NOT modify, add or remove any keys or structural elements. Your job is to only populate the given ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. **Populate the placeholders**:\n",
    "        - Use relevant data from the derivatives contract to replace the placeholders of the keys.\n",
    "        - DO NOT directly copy information into the placeholder without considering its intended purpose.\n",
    "        - For the given key, identify the best suited information from the given contract description and populate the corresponding placeholder\n",
    "            - To achieve this, you must use the prior context (traversal path) to understand what exactly is needed and then you must look for that information very carefully in the contract description.\n",
    "            For example, if the traversal path has any kind of 'date' as a substring, you must know that the placeholder will be a date.\n",
    "        - DO NOT add any commentrary, explanation, etc while replacing the placeholders. Use just the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. **Maintain the same datatype**:\n",
    "        - If the given object or the placeholder of any key is an empty string (\\\"\\\"), replace it with a STRING derived from the contract description.\n",
    "        - Or if it is a LIST, populate it with a LIST of items derived from the contract information (add as many items as necessary). The output MUST BE a LIST.\n",
    "        - Ensure that the placeholder is replaced with data of the correct type and structure.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        4. **Leave placeholder unchanged if no data is available**:\n",
    "        - If no highly relevant data exists for the given key, leave its placeholder as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "        5. **Populate \"description\"-only keys**:\n",
    "        - If a key contains only \"description\", populate it with ENUMERATED VALUES based on the description\n",
    "\n",
    "        6. **Final reminder about the output format**:\n",
