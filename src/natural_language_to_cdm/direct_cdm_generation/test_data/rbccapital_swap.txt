Risk Information   
Issuer Risk: Investors bear the issuer risk. The investment instrument’s value is dependent not only on the 
development of the underlying, but also on the creditworthiness of the issuer, which may vary over the 
term of the structured product.  The ratings of the Issuer noted above reflect the independent opinion of 
the rating agencies as to the safety of payments of principal and interest.  These ratings are not a 
guarantee of credit quality.  The ratings do not take into consideration any risk associated with 
fluctuations in the market value of this instrument, or where factors other than the Issuer’s credit quality 
determine the level of principal and interest payments.  
Liquidity Risk: The investor should be prepared to hold this note until maturity should it not be called or terminated 
early, if such option exists, by the Issuer.  RBC will, however, use its reasonable endeavours to provide 
liquidity to the Note but is not obliged to do so and may stop providing liquidity at any time without notice. 
The price at which you purchase the Note includes selling commissions paid by RBC and hedging costs 
and profits that RBC or its affiliates expect to incur or realize.  These selling commissions, costs and 
profits will reduce the secondary market price, if any secondary market develops, for the Note.  As a 
result, you may experience an immediate and substantial decline in the value of your notes on the issue 
date. 

Suitability: This document is being provided to you based on our reasonable belief that you are a sophisticated 
institutional investor that is capable of assessing the merits and risks of the matters discussed herein. It 
is expressly not directed at private or retail clients. Institutions referencing this document or extracting 
information from this document with which to advise their clients will need to ensure that the information 
satisfies their local jurisdictional requirements and applicable securities laws for conducting business 
with private and /or retail clients.
